# Course Project: Understand Linux OS via Modern Tool (Systemtap)

### Abstract—Operating system (OS) is a piece of software that helps users to operate the hardware. To understand the operating system, it is very important to know it’s internal logic and performance characteristics. The purpose of this project is to understand and observe the internal behaviors and performance characteristics of Linux operating system. In exploring the relations among some of these quantities, I have used a dynamic tracing tool namely Systemtap.
